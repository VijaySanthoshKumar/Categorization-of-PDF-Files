# Categorization-of-PDF-Files
Hi,  I have 1000s of pdf files, i  need R code to categories each and every one of the pdf files whether it is relevant or not, by searching for machine part names from a csv file.  if a pdf file have more than any 50 words that are in the csv file then that pdf file should move to a folder called relevant else it should move to irrelevant using R/R studio. I am attaching 3 pdf files and the .csv file  i am totally confused on how to write the code, it will be really helpful if anyone could share me the code for the same.  The final objective is to do text mining on pdf files but not on all the 1000s of file, but only on relevant file.
